        "1. Define the role of a Data Analyst in your own words. What value do they bring to an organization?\n",
        "    - A Data Analyst is someone who turns raw data into clear, useful information that helps people make better decisions. They collect, clean, and analyze data, then interpret what the numbers mean in a real-world context. Instead of just reporting figures, they explain why something is happening and what can be done about it.\n",
        "2.  List three tools commonly used by Data Analysts and explain what each is mainly used for.\n",
        "    - 1.Microsoft Excel Excel is widely used for data cleaning, basic analysis, and quick calculations. Data analysts use it to sort and filter data, create formulas, build pivot tables, and generate simple charts. It’s especially useful for small to medium-sized datasets and fast exploratory analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "     2.SQL (Structured Query Language) SQL is used to access and manipulate data stored in databases. Data analysts rely on SQL to query large datasets, filter records, join multiple tables, and aggregate data (such as totals or averages). It is essential for retrieving accurate data efficiently from relational databases.\n",
        "\n",
        "     3.Tableau (or Power BI) Tableau is a data visualization tool used to create interactive dashboards and reports. It helps analysts present insights in a clear and visually engaging way, making complex data easier for stakeholders to understand and explore without technical expertise.\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, these tools help data analysts collect data, analyze it, and communicate insights effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Write the end-to-end analytics workflow in the correct order and briefly explain each step.\n",
        "    - Define the Problem / Business Question Clearly understand what the organization wants to know or solve. This step sets the goal and determines what data is needed.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "     Data Cleaning and Preparation Fix errors, handle missing values, remove duplicates, and transform data into a usable format. This ensures the data is accurate and consistent.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Data Exploration (Exploratory Data Analysis – EDA) Analyze the data to find patterns, trends, and outliers using statistics and visualizations. This helps understand what the data is telling you.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Data Analysis / Modeling Apply analytical techniques (such as aggregations, comparisons, or basic models) to answer the business question and generate insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Data Visualization and Reporting Present findings using charts, dashboards, and reports that are easy for stakeholders to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Insights, Recommendations, and Decision-Making Interpret the results, explain their impact, and provide actionable recommendations that support business decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Monitoring and Iteration Track results over time and refine the analysis as new data or business needs arise.\n",
        "\n",
        "This workflow helps ensure that analytics is structured, accurate, and aligned with real business goals.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is Prompt Engineering, and explain any two types of prompts used in Generative AI?\n",
        "    - Prompt Engineering is the practice of designing and refining the instructions (prompts) given to a generative AI model so that it produces accurate, relevant, and useful outputs. A well-written prompt clearly tells the AI what to do, how to do it, and sometimes the format or style of the response.\n",
        "\n",
        "     1)Zero-Shot Prompt In a zero-shot prompt, the AI is asked to perform a task without being given any examples. It relies entirely on its existing knowledge to generate an answer.\n",
        "     2)Few-Shot Prompt In a few-shot prompt, the user provides a small number of examples to show the AI exactly what kind of response is expected.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are the key differences between a Business Analyst and a Data Analyst in terms of roles, responsibilities, and focus?\n",
